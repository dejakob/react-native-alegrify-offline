<p>
  Alegrify was a web service to improve your mental health by challenging your own thoughts.
  While the service is offline, the app can still be used, allthough all of the features that required networking have been removed.

## User Interface

The User Interface has been built with components from the [react-native-alegrify-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-alegrify-ui) package. Take a look [here](https://dejakob.com/react-native-alegrify-ui) to read the docs.
